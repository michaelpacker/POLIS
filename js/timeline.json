      "text": "IUPUI was established in 1969 as a merger of Indiana University and Purdue University campuses in Indianapolis in response to a challenge by the city’s mayor to build a great state university. In the years since then, IUPUI has grown rapidly to meet the higher-education needs of the city, state, and world. It has become the premier urban research university in Indiana. IUPUI can trace its roots back to 1891, when Indiana University first offered lectures in Indianapolis. But many of the schools that became parts of IUPUI predate that event. IUPUI has a rich history that stretches far into the past. This timeline shows the development of IUPUI, first from 1969 to the present. Later, it will outline the nineteenth-century roots of IUPUI and its many parts."

        "secondary_headline": "Developing a Common View",
        "secondary_text": "In the coming years, the commission, with the input from hundreds of IUPUI faculty and administrators, wrestled with developing a common view of general education for IUPUI's undergraduates. Along the way, IUPUI leaders received advice from the North Central Association accreditors to focus on key outcomes for general education that could be assessed meaningfully. In 1993, the commission developed eight Principles of Undergraduate Learning: higher order thinking; critical thinking; intellectual adaptability; self awareness; collaborative learning; co-curricular learning; understanding diversity, and service learning. In 1994, during discussions to merge the IUPUI School of Liberal Arts and the School of Science (a merger which did not occur), school leaders developed a condensed list of five principles of undergraduate learning in the course of considering a potential core curriculum. The faculty governance bodies of the two schools approved this condensed form in 1998.",
        "tertiary_headline": "Five Principles Adopted",
        "tertiary_text": "Meanwhile, discussions occurred widely across the larger campus regarding principles of undergraduate learning. By early 1998, the five Principles adopted by Liberal Arts and Science became six, with \"understanding society and culture\" and \"values and ethics\" divided into separate principles. The IUPUI Faculty Council approved the six Principles of Undergraduate Learning at its meeting of May 7, 1998. In the following years, work to incorporate the PULS into the curricula of all undergraduate programs commenced. While the PULS served IUPUI well, in 2018 the IUPUI Faculty Council replaced them with \"IUPUI+,\" or \"PLUS,\" which is a refinement and updating of the original principles."

        "secondary_headline": "From Modest Beginnings",
        "secondary_text": "However, as has typically been the IUPUI experience, from modest beginnings grew great things. The 1969 merger of Purdue and Indiana University campuses in the state capital brought together academic units spread all over Indianapolis. Neither IU-Indianapolis nor the Purdue-Indianapolis Extension had intercollegiate athletics programs. Nowhere in the merger was there any thought about sports at IUPUI. Early administrators worked to consolidate disparate campuses as quickly as possible into the near-westside location, and while intercollegiate sports received the attention of the influential Goals and Objectives Committee of 1971, other issues took priority. At first, IUPUI contented itself with a lively intramural sports program under the direction of P. Nicholas (\"Nick\") Kellum, an instructor in the Normal College (later the IU School of Physical Education). Meanwhile, in the early 1970s and with the blessing of the president's office in Bloomington, various regional campuses in the IU system around the state began to test the intercollegiate-athletics waters. Several campuses established men's basketball teams and competed with other schools around the state and region. In 1970-1971, the Indiana University-Kokomo men's team compiled an enviable record in games against other IU regionals, Purdue's regional campuses, the Indiana State University-Evansville team, and even the Grissom Air Force base team. IUK announced it would host a four-team IU-regional campus tournament on March 6, 1971, to feature IUK, IUPU-Fort Wayne, IU-Southeast, and IU-South Bend. But IU-South Bend bowed out of the tournament at the last minute. IUPUI came to the rescue.",
        "tertiary_headline": "Little Red",
        "tertiary_text": "In January 1971, Nick Kellum's IUPUI intramural men's basketball tournament had crowned as campus champions a team of students from the Normal College. Thus, when Kellum received a call from the IUK coach asking if he could supply a replacement team for the regional tournament, he turned to the intramural champions and entered them in the Kokomo tourney to replace the IU-South Bend team. Kellum appointed himself coach for the team, with Normal College Professor Dr. Rudolph R. Schreiber listed in the tournament program as \"Rep.\" The program and the IUK student newspaper both identified the team as the Normal College IUPUI team, which had no other team name. The first matchup that Saturday began at 12:30pm in a high-school gym in Kokomo and pitted IUK against the IUPUI Normal College players. The contest between an IUK \"Little Red\" team with a 19 wins and 4 losses record and a pick-up squad was lopsided. The hosts quickly outplaying the visitors. The halftime score was 56 to 32; at the final buzzer it was IUK 114, IUPUI 75. According to the (unnamed) writer for the IUK student newspaper, The Student Voice, the Normal College players were \"small but husky.\" The leading IUPUI player was Shelton Oakes, \"who muscled his way for twenty points and 11 rebounds... He didn't get much help from anyone else though and that was the story of the game.\" The IUK coach used his bench extensively, \"substituting platoon style, five a side.\" After a few hours of rest to lick their wounds, the IUPUI boys played their second game of the day against IUPU-Fort Wayne, the losers of a first-round match-up against IU-Southeast. The 6:30pm tip-off saw IUPUI rally and prevail in overtime over the Mastodons 82-79. The IUK sports reporter termed the result an upset. The IUPUI players thus took home the third-place trophy. The Normal College players who constituted the IUPUI team were: Mike Carr; Ralph Scott; Craig Marshall; Steve Davis, Shelton Oakes; Joe Lentz; Ron Foley; Joe Stewart; Tom Steele; John Schrock; Jeff Vessely; Dave Younce; Tom Fox, and Chris Lawrie. Jeff Vessely later joined the faculty of the School of Physical Education and Tourism Management and served as a department chair and dean. This competition escaped the notice of the two student newspapers at IUPUI, Onomatopoeia of the \"Downtown Campus\" and the 38th Street campus's Component. Partly for this reason, little is known about IUPUI's participation in the IUK tournament and the origins of IUPUI intercollegiate competiton. From these humble roots the IUPUI athletic program developed. Programs for men and women soon began. IUPUI joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), later switching to the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division II and still later NCAA Division I. Starting out by fielding an unnamed team, IUPUI players later were known as the Metros, and later still the Jaguars."

Statistics revealed that 7 to 8 percent of the US population suffered from genetic diseases. In 1974, Dr. Walter E. Nance, professor of medical genetics, became director of the new center. Its early researchers concentrated in such areas as hereditary deafness, identical twins and their families, variations in human proteins and enzymes, chromosome abnormalities, the effectiveness of genetic counseling, and the roles of chromosomes in human genes.",

Other significant grants followed, setting the stage for Indiana University to take a leading role in genetic research. The Center for Medical Genomics at IUSM provides state-of-the-art technology, research, and services. Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics Faculty provide counseling for a variety of hereditary conditions and birth defects, and by 2015, IUSM board-certified geneticists served more than 2,000 people per year."

The press statement noted that ending the baseball program would allow IUPUI to \"strengthen financially its support of the remaining fourteen sports teams.\" It explained that the university did not have its own baseball field and had to rent facilities, the only IUPUI team that had to do so. The team played some seasons in Bush Stadium and Victory Field, the venues of the Triple AAA professional team, the Indianapolis Indians. The large number of games (56) and the extensive travel for the team also added significant expense.",

The team met with success through the NAIA years, but when the IUPUI switched to NCAA play, first Division II, then Division I, the team struggled to achieve winning seasons."

Since the 1950s the universities had been in talks to create a joint campus in Indianapolis. City leaders had been party to the talks, but university leaders could not agree about how to finance the new entity. In the following days and weeks, TV and newspapers editorialized on Lugar's speech and reinforced his message calling for action. Legislators promised to introduce bills to create a new university for the city. University leaders were thus forced to act to preserve control of their Indianapolis campus assets."

In 1986, a Yale University study recognized MEAP as a model program, citing it as the only one of its kind to offer programs for junior high schoolers. MEAP has taken advantage of IUPUI’s location in both the most diverse and most economically active area of Indiana by gaining the cooperation and financial support of major businesses such as Eli Lilly, Dow Chemical, Ford Motor Company, and RCA.

        "secondary_text": "As the sport of tennis began attracting more fans, the city of Indianapolis needed a newer, larger venue to continue to host the US Clay Court Championships, which had been held at the Indianapolis Racquet Club since 1969. Built in 1978-1979, the Indianapolis Tennis Center included six courts covered and not used during winter, two courts with 2,000 seats, and a main court with 12,000 seats. The stadium could be used for smaller events and recreational activities, in addition to large events like the Clay Courts. The main court could also be used for other events including concerts, ice skating, and youth hockey. The $4-million plan faced some opposition, but most people felt the large venue could bolster a positive image for the city, while bringing more money downtown.",
        "tertiary_headline": "Association of Tennis Professionals",
        "tertiary_text": "Private donations funded most of the cost. In 1979, the first US Clay Court Championships held at the center sold more tickets than the tournament ever had. It continued to host the US Clay Courts Championships until 1987. From 1988 to 2009, the Indianapolis Tennis Championships, part of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour, replaced the Clay Courts as its most important tournament. Between 1984 and 2001, the stadium won the United States Tennis Association Facilities Award eleven times. Famous tennis players who played at the Indianapolis Tennis Center included Arthur Ashe, Andre Agassi, and Pete Sampras. Unfortunately, sponsorships for the ATP tournament fell into decline. The Indianapolis Tennis Championships moved out of Indianapolis in 2009. Without the funding that this warm-up event for the US Open provided, the stadium closed. It was demolished in 2010. The 2009 IUPUI master plan looked to redesign this part of campus to integrate it better with downtown Indianapolis and White River State Park."

The IARC continued to develop methods of DNA analyzation that verified specific genes as being associated with alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease, pancreatitis, dementia, and depression. The IARC has received continuous funding over the past thirty years from the NIAAA with a continued focus on biological bases for differences in the way people drink alcohol as well as the trajectories that lead to alcohol-use disorders."

The need for housing on campus had reached a crisis point, with more than 200 students wait-listed. Converting University Place Conference Center and Hotel to accommodate these students fit with the campus master plan.

Dr. Hugh Hendrie took the lead in the development of the Alzheimer’s research program at the Indiana University School of Medicine starting in 1987. He and other physicians and researchers established the center in 1991 to bring comprehensive support to patients who were suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and to their families as well. Early services of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center included home visits, family counseling, and complete diagnostics. During its first year in 1991, researchers began a groundbreaking study in Ibadan, Nigeria, hoping to learn how risk factors differ between Africans in Nigeria and African Americans in Indianapolis. The study concluded in 2001, and investigators found that African Americans are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementia related illnesses than Africans in Ibadan. This study was the first to compare incident rates for the disease in industrialized and nonindustrialized populations.",

In 2017, the National Institute on Aging awarded a $7.6-million grant to the IU School of Medicine to establish a network of sites across the United States to study early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Liana G. Apostolova, MD, the Barabara and Peer Baekgaard Professor of Alzheimer’s Disease Research, leads this study that enrolled a large cohort of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease participants to better understand this rare variant of Alzheimer’s Disease."

        "secondary_text": "Indiana University’s decision to turn over healthcare management services to Clarian Health allowed the IU School of Medicine to develop further as a first-rate medical education institution and assured the economic viability of Indiana University Hospitals for future generations. As the Indiana University School of Medicine rapidly expanded its education, research, and patient care programs with increased demand for healthcare and its booming innovations, IU began struggling to internally manage and operate University Hospital and Riley Hospital at the IU Medical Center. The largest private health care facility in the state, Methodist Hospital, which had operated independently since 1908, joined with Indiana University Hospitals to form Clarian Health. Indiana University entrusted Clarian Health with the management and operation of Indiana University Hospitals, including patient care programs and all other healthcare resources, so that the IU School of Medicine could turn its focus towards medical education and research.",
        "tertiary_headline": "Effort to Unify",
        "tertiary_text": "In an effort to unify the then physically disconnected entities of Indiana University Medical Center and Methodist Hospital into one consolidated medical campus, Clarian Health constructed the now well-known ‘people mover’ tram to operate between the two. This significant visionary and financial commitment created the feel of one campus for Methodist and IU Hospitals in a practical way by establishing a much faster and safer mode of transportation between the two locations than the previous shuttling system. The people mover, however, ceased operation in February 2019 due to high maintenance and operation costs, and a surface shuttle system was reinstated. As the relationship between Clarian Health and Indiana University grew and became more exclusive through the extended work of establishing sixteen IU Hospitals throughout the state of Indiana, Clarian Health took on the name of Indiana University Health in early 2011."

In 1993, the school moved to NCAA Division II. However, IUPUI was the largest campus by enrollment in all of Division II by 1997. IUPUI, therefore, saw an opportunity to increase its national profile by developing its athletics programs to keep up with the campus’s growing population and academic achievement. Developing institutional pride among the student body and distinguishing itself as distinct from its parent campuses in West Lafayette and Bloomington had proven to be a challenge for IUPUI.",
        "tertiary_headline": "Increase School Spirit",
        "tertiary_text": "Chancellor Gerald Bepko and Athletic Director Michael Moore saw the move to Division I as a way to increase school spirit among students and to develop a unique identity for IUPUI. Along with boosting school pride, the move also increased the number of scholarships available and exposed IUPUI to a national audience. To meet the Division I requirement of 14 sports and adequate gender equity, IUPUI added Men’s Swimming and Diving, Women’s Golf, Women’s Soccer, and Women’s Track and Field teams. In November 1997, IUPUI accepted an invitation to join the Mid-Continent Conference, which had actively recruited IUPUI and assisted in its move up to Division I. To reinforce the sense of beginning a new era of IUPUI athletics, students were given a chance to vote on a new mascot and logo. Starting with the Fall 1998 semester, the IUPUI Metros became the IUPUI Jaguars."

Bepko declared construction of a campus center to be one of the most critical projects in IUPUI’s development to establish it as a modern university. In 1999, he hired Karen Whitney as vice chancellor for student life, to develop the financial planning and funding, design, and construction of a new campus center. After approving a design, finding an architect, and raising almost $50 million in funds from student fees, private sector financing, and gifts, Whitney began the most significant undertaking in IUPUI’s history.",

All of IUPUI was heavily engaged in the Campus Center and the future of the university. A main concern for the center was its inclusion of food options, as many students hiked it to the nearby hospitals for food or scrounged from vending machines. Another issue was the addition of numerous classrooms, business rooms, auditoriums, and a theater for organizational use, and all were eventually included. In January of 2008, the Campus Center officially opened its doors to students, although it did not become fully accessible until April. The Campus Center serves as the home of the IUPUI student as a central location that links student life to academic life. The center is constantly changing to accommodate student needs, as seen with the constant additions for physical fitness, entertainment, and food options. The campus canter has and will continue to be the center for all campus activities, and it continues to validate IUPUI as an official campus in the eyes of all who visit."

Built on land donated by Indiana University, the original house had twenty-four rooms. In 1989, a new wing was constructed, adding twenty guest rooms and six apartments that were designed for transplant patients and their families. Two more rooms were added in 2001, and, in 2004, another six new guest rooms were included in one of Riley Hospital’s critical care units. A day respite area was also made available to any family with an inpatient. Since 1982, more than 35,000 families representing every Indiana county have stayed at the Ronald McDonald House. These families have not only found affordable housing at the house but also caring volunteers and staff to help them through difficult times."

        "secondary_text": "A planning committee investigated the feasibility of establishing the center to meet a growing need for understanding the role philanthropy in society and for better trained people to work in nonprofits. This planning committee produced a proposal that the the IU Board of Trustees approved in February 1987. Initial goals for the center included development of research in philanthropy and academic courses in cultural aspects of philanthropy. The original proposal also outlined programs in resource development and fundraising management and a professional field of public service in fundraising. In 1988, the Fund Raising School, which had been established in San Francisco in 1974, moved to the center, and the first philanthropy courses were held on the IUPUI campus.",

Payton, who had served as president of the Exxon Education Foundation, as United States ambassador to the Republic of Cameroon in West Africa, and as president of C. W. Post College and Hofstra University in New York, became founding director of the center. During these formative years, the IU Center on Philanthropy played a groundbreaking role in development of philanthropic studies as an academic discipline and field of study leading to the establishment of the IU School of Philanthropy in 2012, renamed the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy in 2013. The school is the first ever dedicated solely to the study and teaching of philanthropy."

Up to that point, Indianapolis and its metropolitan area had been understudied. IUPUI faculty members recognized the opportunity to study Indianapolis as an example of a changing Mid-American city and created the Polis Center to carry out this mission. The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis was IUPUI's gift to the city upon the occasion of the campus's 20th anniversary.",

It became the standard comprehensive reference work on the city. Providing social, cultural, economic, historical, physical, and statistical information about Indianapolis and eight surrounding counties, it was considered a “model of what a modern city encyclopedia should be.” In 2018-2019, the Polis Center received funding from the Allen Whitehill Clowes Charitable Foundation to create the Digital Encyclopedia of Indianapolis for the city’s bicentennial in 2020-2021. The digital version will update and revise the Encyclopedia of Indianapolis in an innovative, digital, knowledge platform."
